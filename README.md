### Overview
The Registry of Justice (RoJ) is an all-encompassing application designed for the Advocacy for Criminal Case Reform (ACCR). Aimed at improving operational efficiency, enhancing communication, and streamlining event and volunteer management, RoJ integrates several modules within a single platform. These modules include Webinar Registration, Event Calendar, Call Organizer, In Kind Donations, Mail Manager, Mapping Justice, and Pro Bono Tracker, each developed to support ACCR in organizing webinars, managing events, tracking communications and donations, handling correspondence, visualizing justice-related data, and monitoring volunteer contributions.

### Features and Instructions
#### Webinar Registration & Event Calendar
Functionality: Facilitates the registration process for webinars and events, while allowing administrators to manage these events within a centralized calendar.
Usage: Administrators can add, edit, or delete event listings through the Event Calendar section, where users can view and register for upcoming or past events.

#### Call Organizer
Functionality: Provides a system for recording, organizing, and tracking phone calls with the capability to associate calls with specific cases or individuals.
Usage: Admins can log new calls, edit existing records, and organize calls by case association or callback needs via the Call Organizer module.

#### In Kind Donations
Functionality: Tracks non-monetary donations, such as goods or services, offering tools for managing and reviewing these contributions.
Usage: Users input data on in-kind donations, which is then cataloged for easy access and management, supporting ACCR in acknowledging and handling these donations effectively.

#### Mail Manager
Functionality: A comprehensive system for managing mail entries, equipped with advanced search capabilities and customizable tags for efficient sorting and retrieval.
Usage: Staff members have the ability to add, modify, or remove mail entries, and can utilize filters to search for mail by various criteria, including case status, recipient demographics, and keywords.

#### Mapping Justice
Functionality: An interactive map providing visual data representation related to capital punishment across Pennsylvania, including case statistics and demographic information.
Usage: Users can explore the map to view detailed statistics by county, compare data across different regions, and gain insights into the state's justice dynamics.

#### Pro Bono Tracker
Functionality: Enables the recording and tracking of volunteer contributions using a timesheet-based approach, facilitating the management of time, money, and effort donated to the organization.
Usage: Staff and volunteers can log their contributions, which are then compiled and stored for organizational review, planning, and recognition.
