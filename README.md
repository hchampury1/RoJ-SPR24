# Welcome to _PayPal Payment Mechanism_ of the _Rails of Justice Project_

## TeamPayPal (Team 12)

### Description of the Project
 Many organizations, including ACCR, rely on Excel spreadsheets to manage their data, but this approach may not be the most efficient one, especially when it comes to payment-related data for meetings and webinars. Currently, ACCR uses an Excel file with multiple columns for storing attendees' information and payment status. However, this method can make it difficult to analyze the data and keep track of changes made by different staff members, leading to inaccuracies and inconsistencies. As ACCR continues to host more events, the Excel sheet becomes overcrowded and unwieldy. Therefore, implementing a payment platform such as PayPal can offer a more effective way of managing payment data. By integrating PayPal into the Rails of Justice application, ACCR can provide its clients with a secure and convenient payment method while also leveraging PayPal's fraud detection and other security features. This approach can help ACCR overcome data management challenges and streamline its payment processes 
 
### Proposed Solution
As a group, we would like to build a payment mechanism that links to PayPal. We would like to make it possible for customers to make payments on the ROJ  website/application utilizing PayPal as the payment gateway since PayPal is a well-known payment processor that enables people and businesses to send and receive payments online securely. By integrating PayPal into a payment system for the ROJ application, customers can pay for the webinars and meetings they would like to attend.  In order to create the PayPal-linked payment platform, we intend to use PayPal’s APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to connect the ROJ application to PayPal’s payment processing system. This normally entails developing a payment form that gathers customer data including payment information and transferring that data to PayPal for processing. Therefore, by integrating with PayPal, ACCR can provide their clients with a convenient and safe way to make payments while also gaining access to PayPal’s fraud detection and other built-in security mechanisms.
