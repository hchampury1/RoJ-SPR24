### Administration

To access the admin interface, go to the /admin page. It's powered by rails admin. (A remake of django-admin)

Home#index

Find me at `src/app/views/home/index.html.erb`. Make sure to clear out the file before you start working. The other files, `_erb`, `_mvc`, `_filetree` can be deleted.

### This Template

This rails 6 template will give you a good starting point when working on software engineering projects. The following have already been installed and configured...

    Rails 6 (the project, at least)
    Bootstrap 4
    Devise user authentication system
    better_errors (replace default error page with a better one)
    web_console (put <% console %> in a view to have a console on the page)
    A basic layout
    User logins

## Devise

Devise is a user authentication system for ruby on rails designed around another program called warden. You will not need to change anything regarding its settings unless you are changing login behavior, which is unlikely.

This means that you do not need to create your own login/registration forms, devise already includes this functionality and it can be used within your project implementation!

To make a page not require login, add skip_before_action :authenticate_user! on top of the controller. To limit it to specific methods of a controller, tack on only: ['method_name'] at the end of the line. You can add more than one method.

## Bootstrap

Bootstrap is a CSS and javascript library made by twitter to "bootstrap" website development. CSS can be very difficult to work with. Bootstrap makes it dramatically easier by giving you an entire library of premade classes. For more details, see the documentation.
The MVC Model of web development

Model: data organization
View: the presentation of information to the user
Controller: the manipulation and overseeing of information and access to it

These three categories make up the design of practically every application, desktop or internet enabled. It's the separation of these tasks that keeps an application easy to maintain, write, and read. Please make sure to understand these categories before working with rails. If you don't recall seeing these terms before, check the class slides.

For more information, see Wikipedia.

## File Structure

The rails file structure is strange. Please be patient. You'll learn it in time.

Note: The following has important sections bolded and underlined. The other sections can be largely ignored unless you have some specific need for them. Not automatically made means that a brand new rails project will not contain this file. Some things were made to give you a starting point for the class.

## ERB (Embedded RuBy) basics

To run ruby code, put it in a tag formatted like this:`<% app_name() %> ->`

However, that won't change the HTML sent to the client. In fact, even if we tried to write something that would be part of the document like this:

`<% 'Hello, world!' %> ->`

Nothing happens still? This is because while rails inputs the return value of a block of code like this into the document, it only does so if we tell the language to do so. We do that like this. Add an = to the front of the block.

`<%= 'Hello, world!' %> -> Hello, world!`

And success! However, in doing so, we found something important. If you want to run some code like an if around HTML depending on if the user is logged in or not, use `<% if %> ... <% else %> ... <% end %>`. None of these tags will output anything since there's no =, so you can do things like this. However, if you do want to output something, make sure to use the equal sign at the front, or you'll be confused as to why nothing is printing!



Oh, and comments are like this. `<%# Hiya! %>`. They will not be written to the HTML file sent to the user.



### Writing good `html.erb` files

Here's the golden rule of `erb`: don't process data in the `erb` file! There's nothing to stop you from processing information within the view itself, but this is very bad practice for several reasons.

The main reason is simple. MVC. Model, View, Controller. A view should NOT be fetching its own information or manipulating models. That's the controller's job. Keeping these tasks separate will make your view files highly readable. Speaking from experience, Software Engineering projects can become complex due to (unavoidable, you're learning!) inexperience with web development and the MVC model. Doing your best to follow those guidelines will help you substantially in the last few assignments of the class.

All in all, use the documentation in this template to your advantage! Stack Overflow has tons of resources for ruby on rails and your upperclassmen peers can probably give you a hand with rails questions should you need it. Plus, if you have a student aid to the class, take advantage of them!

Good luck, and have a great semester!
