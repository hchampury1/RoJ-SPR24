# Here are some guidelines for maintaining, improving, and growing the PayPal Payment Mechanism for future public volunteers and students, including programmers and social innovators
- Create a public GitHub repository for the project to encourage collaboration and contributions from the wider community
- Provide extensive documentation for the PayPal API and the integration process as it will assist new contributors in understanding 
the project and getting started as soon as possible
- Create a Slack channel or forum for developers to discuss issues and exchange ideas
- Organize regular code reviews to maintain code quality and uniformity.
- To track changes to the codebase, use a version control system like Git. This allows numerous contributors to work on the project 
at the same time and ensures that modifications are readily monitored and reverted if necessary.
- Create a forum for users to express comments on their user experience and to suggest new features.
- Create a diverse and inclusive team that recognizes and values different points of view and backgrounds.
