### Usage Instructions
Mapping Justice has two main features, the Map module and the Edit module. All users have access to the map module however the edit module is only accessible to Admin users. 

The map feature allows all users to interact with the map of Pennsylvania. This feature can be accessed through the dropdown menu of Mapping Justice or the Mapping Justice homepage. By hovering over a county it will provide all users with information regarding the county's population, death row population, and current incarcerated cases. By clicking on multiple counties, users will have the ability to view charts and compare data based on the counties selected.

The edit module allows admin users to view and edit all data regarding information shown on the map of the counties. Users have the ability to search for a county, making it easier for an admin user to find the exact one needed for updating. To the right of all counties, admin users can click the edit button which will redirect them to a page where they can edit information regarding the county. 

If a large amount of information must be editted, admin users can download the database and upload a new one.
