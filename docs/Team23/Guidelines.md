## Guidelines for Future Project Growth
ACCR is a non-profit organization that works to provide justice to those on the death penalty, specifically in Pennsylvania. By helping improve and maintain this project, we ease the workload of ACCR staff and create a difference in within social justice through technology. Specifically within this module, future developers can create improvements by providing more information in regards to each county and potentially creating more charts/graphs to represent this information. 

When implementing new functionality:
* Make sure to include appropriate documentation within each code file, as well as in the ReadME file of the repository
* Add to the issues page when new issues arise to be fixed in the future
* Follow proper programming guidelines in regards to code headers, documentation, indentation, function calls, and other proper coding practices
