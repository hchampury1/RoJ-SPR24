### CAB Collab 23 Team Code:

1. Respond to any messages (regarding scheduling meetings) within at most 12 hours after the text being sent while also explaining availability, or inability to go to the meeting with reason.

2. Meetings will occur on Tuesday @6:30pm (alternate date Wednesdays @7pm), unless you have another prior obligation, it is expected that you are there.

3. Provide feedback to work done by teammates and allow criticism of your own work.

4. Respect the work of others. If you know of an alternative way of accomplishing a task you may suggest it in a friendly manner.

5. If someone has a question, there cannot be any judgment whatsoever of this person for asking the question, and provide an answer if you are able to.

6. Ensure that everyone has participated/contributed to the assignment. 

7. Communicate when new tasks have been completed through text.

8. Check in with each other regularly to ensure everyone understands the necessary concepts and to make sure no one is falling behind

9. During regular meeting times, make sure to explain what you have accomplished, what you are struggling with, and what you plan to get done within the next week (similar to SCRUM).

10. Have a (friendly) talk with team members who are not doing their part/missing meetings or deadlines.

11. If you have any questions to ask the stakeholder (ACCR), reach out to Julianna and allow her 6 hours to confirm the text was seen, and an additional hour to send a confirmation text after sending the email.

12. Give consideration to any suggestions made.
