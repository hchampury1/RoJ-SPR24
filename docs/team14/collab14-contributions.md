# Opensource Maintenance and Communication
To facilitate communication between developers and community members, project Undefined uses GitHub.

## Where do community members discuss and organize bugs and issues?
To keep community involvement organized, project Undefined uses GitHub's dedicated issue tracking system.
Contributors can report bugs, suggest features, and track the progress of issues on GitHub. Before creating an issue, search for keywords to ensure that duplicate issues are not created.

## Where will community members discuss future plans?
Future plans for the project Undefined application will be discussed under the issues/milestone tabs on GitHub. This feature will allow community members to see what the future plans are for the application, and even suggest their own plans for future development.

## The processes to be followed for contributors to contribute code to the project:
For contributors to contribute code to the project Undefined application, they are required to follow a set of guidelines and processes to ensure that their contributions align with the project's goals and standards. To submit a request, a contributor can fork the project repository, make commits, and submit a pull request to be reviewed.

## Guidelines to determine which code is accepted:
The guidelines that determine which code is accepted are as follows: 
* Follow coding standards by using camel case variable names and adding comments.
* Review and test the code out before making a pull request.
* Create UML diagrams to visually explain the logic of the code.
