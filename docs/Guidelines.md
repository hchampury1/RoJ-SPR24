# Guidelines and Future Collaborative Goals

### Guidelines for Issue Management on GitHub
* Identification of any new bugs/issues in the Pro-Bono module must be addressed in the “Issues” tab on GitHub. 
* When making a new issue on Github, please add labels appropriately to the issue you are trying to address or propose. For example, if the issue is related to a new feature, then the “Enhancement” label would be viable. 
* In the case of the Pro-Bono module, ensure that the title of the issue begins with “PRO-BONO” followed by the issue. 
* You can apply several tags to the same issue. For example, if there is a bug related to UI, you would apply the “UI” and “bug” tags to that issue. 
* Since each team might collaborate in this module at the same time, it is important that for each issue, assign specific team members under the “Assignees Tab”.
* Issue titles should be relatively short (At most one sentence). In-depth descriptions of the issue can be added as a comment.
* If the current issue you encountered when working in the Pro-Bono module already exists on GitHub, please add additional information under the same issue as a comment. Multiple developers working on the same issue can see your comments.

### Ethical Guidelines
* Ensure that you consider all demographics and ethnicities that might use the Pro-Bono Module. For example, when filling in the Pro-Bono form, think about which data types are allowed/not allowed in each form entry, as well as character length. Several countries have name conventions that might contain special characters too. 

### Future Collaborative Goals for RoJ/Pro-Bono Module
* Some of the innovative ways we can encourage new developers/social workers into the Rails of Justice project, especially with our proposal to improve the pro-bono module, is that we can start talking about which third-party lawyers (including those outside of ACCR) might be interested in the module.
* Perhaps in addition to only allowing people taking CSC 415 can contribute to the entire RoJ project, in the long term, there could be another completely different team from different colleges that have similar course objectives as CSC 415 can contribute (i.e a software engineering course in Rutgers might contribute as well).
* Allowing RoJ to be available as a research opportunity at TCNJ might be a neat way to further add a contribution to the project.
