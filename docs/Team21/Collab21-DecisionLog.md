We made a decision to include a requests functionality. This functionality allows users to put in a request to ACCR staff to do a certain webinar. Future developers have to validate and sanitize this input. 
The decision to try and implement that the webinar turns green upon registering may lead to some technical debt since future developers will have to fix the back-end to make this feature work properly upon deregistering. We could only implement this feature partially to deliver and make certain deadlines.
