## How to Use
The Webinar module has several available functions for both Guest and Admin users. These can be accessed through the “Webinars” dropdown on the top navigation bar. 

For Guests:
The “Overview” page gives the option of either viewing the list of Webinars or putting in a request for a new Webinar topic using a form. Simply fill in all of the fields and click “Create Request”. 

The “View Webinars” page, accessed either from “Overviews” or directly from the dropdown, allows the user to “Show” a Webinar (display a more detailed description of the selected Webinar), as well as both Register and Deregister from a Webinar. These actions can be completed by filling in the appropriate fields when prompted and then clicking “Submit”. 

Finally, you can view the Webinar schedule in calendar form by clicking the “View Event Calendar” button at the bottom of the page.

For Admins:
The Admin is privy to a few additional features for this module. On the “Webinars” dropdown, you may select “View Requests” to see Webinar requests which have been submitted by site guests. 

On the “View Webinars” page, there is the “Edit” button, which allows editing of Webinar information such as name, date, description, and the speakers list. Click “Update Webinar” to confirm your changes. The “Show” button will display the Webinar’s current appearance. The “Delete” button will display a warning, before allowing you to remove a Webinar completely off of the Webinars list.

The final function available to Admins on this page is the Export As CSV function. Webinar information, including name, date, description, and list of speakers can either be exported in bulk as one file, or only a portion can be selected using the checkboxes besides each Webinar to be exported, in which case “Export Selected” should be clicked at the bottom of the “View Webinars” page rather than “Export All”.
