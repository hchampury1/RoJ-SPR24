## TEAM CODE
1) Unless otherwise discussed, there is an expectation that all team members will meet starting at 5:00p.m. on Wednesdays. In the event a team member cannot attend, there should be some form of communication discussed in the Slack group chat.
2) The primary form of communication is the Slack group chat. Team members are expected to check this group chat daily. Messages should be responded to in a timely manner, at most a day later.
3) Any document worked on (such as write ups and lucid chart diagrams) should be in the shared drive.
4) All team members should pitch new ideas and provide feedback to other ideas.
5) All team members should treat ideas and communication with respect at all times. 
6) No team member should be afraid to ask for help, and is even encouraged to come to the group when stuck.
7) Work assigned to individuals should be done prior to the deadline and team members should feel comfortable providing updates and requesting help.
8) Team members should produce code with the utmost quality. 
9) Follow GitHub naming standards to create issues, files, and pull requests, and commits.
10) If team members cannot help a team member for their specific question, it is expected that that team member requests help from the professor. 
11) Make sure ideas and designs do not discriminate in any way.
