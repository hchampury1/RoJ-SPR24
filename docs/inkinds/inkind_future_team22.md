# In-Kind Donations
Spring 2023 Team 22

### Suggested Future Contributions
Based on our additions to the In Kind Donations module in the Spring of 2023, there are multiple additions that future contributors can implement to enhance the efficiency of work for the ACCR staff.

Any public developers or social innovators may improve the module by adding the ability for the staff to implement multiple donations types for a single donation. For instance, there are types for goods, services, or facilities but with the current iteration, you can select one type and have multiple submissions of the singular genre. It would make more sense for a donation submission to be a comprehensive collection of everything rendered to ACCR at a specific instance in time. Therefore, the donation form should offer the ability to add specific goods, services, AND facilities and collect all donated items into one donation entry in the application.

Another helpful addition to the application would be a signature function for the current logged in member when exporting the pdf for the writeoff form. There are multiple different admin working at ACCR currently, and the staff may change over time. Therefore, using the logged in credentials, it would be helpful to automatically sign the form when exporting with the admin's name and current date. This would remove the need to print out the form, sign it, and if they need an electronic medium, scan it again with the signature and then send it. With this functionality, it can be directly downloaded and sent.

On top of these two delineated additions, styling changes can be made to enhance accessibility. For those with sight difficulties, increasing the text size or using a different color scheme may be beneficial. Any other additions deemed important and necessary can be implemented as they are thought of and accepted by the ACCR staff.

### Guidelines for Adding Functionality
When making changes to the code, the following guidelines should be adhered to:

New files should have a header regarding its purpose. Code should be well-documented to understand the functionality incorporated.

Additions should be run by the ACCR staff or the project manager before merging to the main branch. All code additions should be made on a separate branch prior to merging and making permanent changes.

Project maintenance and upkeep should be done through GitHub. Found bugs or recommended additions should be documented using the "Issues" function on GitHub.

Altering the database should be done carefully. Dropping any tables or columns may affect the database of the entire system not unique to the In Kind module.
