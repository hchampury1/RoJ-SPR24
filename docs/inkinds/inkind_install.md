[Installation Guide](https://github.com/TCNJ-SE/RoJ-Spr23/blob/collab22-prototype3/docs/Installation_Guide.md)

### Usage Instructions
Once the application is installed and run on a web browser, they can begin accessing and utilizing the Rails of Justice application.

In order to use the In-Kind Donations module, the user must login as an administrator using the login feature in the top right.

Once an administrator successfully logs in, In-Kind Donations will appear in the top nav bar. Clicking the name will display two options: "In-Kind List" and "List of Donors". In-Kind List will redirect the user to the history of In-Kind donations logged in the application. "List of Donors" will redirect the user to the history of previous donors.

From the In-Kind List, there are a series of buttons listed underneath the table. Choosing "New Donation" will redirect the user to the new donation form that they can then fill to add to the database. "View/Edit Donors" will redirect to the donor table, and the donor table has a similar button titled "View Donations" so that the navigation bar is not needed to move between the pages. Lastly under the table, the administrator may choose to download the current data base as comma separated values or a CSV file. On the list of donors, the only difference is a button to add a new dnor titled "New Donor".

In each table, there are several options the user has. Choosing the table column headers, for instance the "Name" cell, will sort the table by the chosen parameter, and a small arrow shows how the data is being sorted. For each entry in the table, you can click the text in the "Name" column in order to view that specific donation or donors information page, containing their data. You can choose "Edit" from the right side of the table to alter any of the data associated with the donation or donor. "Remove" will show a popup asking if the user is sure they wish to permanently delete that entry, and choosing ok from that popup will remove the donation or donor permanently.

One other functionality is available on the "In-Kind List" table. After "Remove", there is an option titled "Export PDF" wherein the administrator may generate a tax writeoff document with the data for the specific donation on which the button was chosen.
