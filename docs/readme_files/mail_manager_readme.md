# Mail Manager

### Description 
The Mail Manager module is an efficient way to store and search for mail. Staff members are able to add mail entries to the database as well as delete from, and modify them. You are also able to search for the mail using filters, such as the status of the case the mail refers to (pending, complete, not started), the date that mail was received, characteristics of the victim and offender (race, gender, age), the age of the offender when the crime happened, the location where the crime took place, and the SBI (Offender ID) of the offender. Staff members can also search for keywords; these keywords will have to be inputted when the mail entry was added. More filters can be added. Additionally, there is a tags system in place that allows ACCR staff to create and delete custom tags that they find most suitable for their methods of tracking emails. Finally, there is a responses section that generates a sample response letter based on the tags of the initial inquiry.
