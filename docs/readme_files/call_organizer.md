# Call Organizer

### Description
Call Organizer aims to help ACCR keep track of their phone calls by adding a table that keeps records of the calls received and associates them with specific cases and individuals. The user will be able to input phone calls made or missed including caller information such as: individual's name, inmate number, institution [business, vendor], date, and notes (description of the call). These inputted calls could then be tagged in order to associate them with a specific case. The call log would provide the functionality to add, edit, and remove calls from the list through an user interface. If the call is missed, the status of the call could be set to indicate a need for callback. Overall, our goal is to promote organization and strengthen the communication between ACCR and their clients by providing a system to keep track of all phone calls. Through this interactive feature ACCR will be able to more effectively return missed calls, relate calls to specific cases, and reference information collected during the call.
