# In Kind Donations

### Description
The In Kind module is used to track In-Kind donations. User-inputted data for these donations are stored in a database for tracking as well as for retrieving the information to review. An In Kind is where somebody/some organization donates services/goods rather than money. For example, if a company were to donate space to ACCR to host an event, that is an In Kind Donation.
